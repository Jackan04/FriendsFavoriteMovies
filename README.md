# FriendsFavoriteMovies

This app was designed for educational purposes. It’s a CRUD application built in Swift and SwiftUI, utilizing SwiftData. The app allows users to add friends, including their names, birthdates, and favorite movies. The movies are represented as a separate data entity (title and release date), which can be searched and filtered in the view.

## Practiced Concepts

1. Relationships between data (Friend and Movie)

2. SwiftData

3. Custom filtering with *Predicates*: Users can search all movies

4. Full CRUD
